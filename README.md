Auto_Class_Recommender
===============================
This program gives classes you can take based on classes you have taken by selecting checkboxes in Tkinter UI.    
This time, I use a degree plan for Software engineering at The University of Texas at Dallas.
The degree plan can be refered in docs.

Getting Started
-------------------------------
**Prerequisites**         
- Python3.6
- NetworkX packege
----------------------------
**Running the tests**    
- By clicking option menu, Select one domain as default, It gives you choices of domain. Once selected and clicked 'Add guided electives to the list', it will add classes corresponding to the chosen domain on display.   
- Clicking 'Show' after selecting all classes you have taken and checked them pops a new window which shows 'Total credit hours', 'Classification', 'Domain', and 'Classes you can take'.

*Note*          
- I learned Data Structure and Algorithm myself over winter break, 2017-2018, and applied graph theory to the program. Also, I learned Tkinter and NetworkX packeges myself to apply to the program.    
- I am going to take the class in Spring 2018. Therefore, this program may be enriched and sharpen better after the semester, as such applying weighted edges to give us best option, etc.    
- Also, I am thinking of coloring the degree plan to have better visualization. For example, classes you have taken are colored yellow, and classes you can take are blue. I am currently working on this plus algorithm for corequisite.

Last update: 1/4/18   
In this program, AutoClass_vol1.1, corequisites are not cosidered yet.
