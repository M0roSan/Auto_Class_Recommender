Auto_Class_Recommender
===============================
This program gives classes you can take based on classes you have taken by selecting checkboxes in UI.    
This time, I use a degree plan for Software engineering at The University of Texas at Dallas.
The degree plan can be refered in docs.

Getting Started
-------------------------------
**Prerequiisites**

**Running the tests**    
- By clicking option menu, Select one domain as default, It gives you choices of domain. Once selected and clicked 'Add guided electives to the list', it will add classes corresponding to the chosen domain on display.   
- Clicking 'Show' after selecting all classes you have taken and checked them pops a new window which shows 'Total credit hours', 'Classification', 'Domain', and 'Classes you can take'.
